(def about-md '("###Interest In Clojure:"
                "I first became interested in studying functional programming after reading 'Functional Light Programming' by Kyle Simpson - a very good book on using javascript with the functional paradigm. His direction and examples gave me a vocabulary for a type of programming I preferred but hadnt studied formally. Essentially - globals always drove me nuts.  One of my first professonal programming jobs was in PHP and the lead developer had a global instance of a DB connection that was used to run all queries.  He was constantly getting on my case for passing the db into functions that ran queries. I told him that I didn't care that it was global. If i pass it in, I know how it got there." "This new interest would lead me to reading up on haskell, erlang and others but the one that I enjoyed the most was Clojure. I didn't know exactly what I was getting into when I started browsing Higginbotham's 'Clojure for the Brave and True' which I had gotten as part of a HumbleBundle of ebooks but it definitely resonated with me." "After that and a few Rich Hickey videos I was hooked."))

  "Thanks for visiting my page. My name is Michael Cuccaro. In order, I am a father, a husband and a programmer.  My programming career spans many years and created this page to highlight some of my recent projects and to give myself a project to practice Clojure on. I have worked with many technologies over the years including but not limited to PHP, Javascript, Jquery, Node, VueJS, Puppeteer, Appium, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Git, Docker, subversion, Bash... I work primarily with Linux servers - typically CentOS or Debian and prefer to work on a Debian desktop with Sublime Text as my editor of choice. This page is a custom SPA build with ClojureScript and Reagent.
